# Wel-Come_Timezone
Working with dates in JavaScript. Had to navigate various methods, formats, and time zones. In this project, I had learned how to work with the JavaScript Date object, including its methods and properties. I had also learned how to correctly format dates.

This project covered concepts such as the getDate(), getMonth(), and getFullYear() methods.
Thank-You!
